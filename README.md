OnePlusPlusLauncher is an Xposed/LSPosed module for the System Launcher on OxygenOS 15 that hooks into the application using the [YukiHookAPI](https://github.com/HighCapable/YuKiHookAPI) framework. It modifies app drawer search functions: automating keyboard display, enabling instant app launch from search, redirecting search actions to the app drawer, and providing optional fuzzy search.

## üì¶ Installation

**Before downloading, please check the release notes of the version you are downloading to see if it is compatible with your launcher version.**

2. Download the latest release APK (or any other older release) from the [releases page](https://github.com/wizpizz/OnePlusPlusLauncher/releases)
3. Install the APK on your device.
4. Enable the module in the LSPosed manager and make sure System Launcher is enabled in the scope settings.
5. Restart System Launcher.

(Restarting the launcher may be necessary for changes to take effect after toggling features.)

## ‚ö° Features

* ‚å®Ô∏è **Automatic Keyboard / Searchbar Focus:** Automatically displays the keyboard when the app drawer is opened and search is focused. Can be toggled separately for opening app drawer by swiping up or redirecting from the Global Search Button.
* ‚Ü©Ô∏è **App Launch on Enter:** Launches the first search result directly when the "Enter" key or search action button on the keyboard is pressed.
* üîé **Global Search Button Redirect:** Intercepts the search button in the homescreen that would normally open the dedicated global search app, redirecting to the main app drawer instead.
* üì± **Swipe Down Search Redirect:** Intercepts swipe down search gestures and redirects them to the app drawer instead of the default search interface. Includes optional auto focus for seamless search experience.
* üçë **Fuzzy Search:** Replaces the default search logic with a ranked fuzzy search algorithm for more flexible matching.
* ‚öôÔ∏è **Configuration UI:** Allows toggling features individually, including auto focus options for different interaction methods.

## üîÆ To-Do

* Rewrite the module UI using Jetpack Compose instead of the current Android Views/XML implementation.
* A decent app icon 
* And many other refactorings and improvements...

## üîß Troubleshooting / Known Issues

*   **Compatibility / Launcher Updates:** Launcher updates may break hooks. Class names, field names, or method signatures might change, requiring updates to the module.
