# üöÄ OnePlusPlusLauncher v1.2.0 Release 

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important

**This version has only been tested on the latest launcher OxygenOS launcher version v15.8.17.**

With all the backwards compatibility with older versions of the launcher, the code was becoming more and more unorganized. The next release will have a lot of refactoring and how older versions of the launcher are handled will be modularized. This was not included in this release due to time constraints, and wanting to get out this release with the fix for the latest version of the launcher.

If you are using an older version of the launcher, please use an older release, or wait for the next release.

## üìù Changelog

    * **Intercept/redirect Google Discover to app drawer**: When swiping left on the home screen, the app drawer will be opened and the search input will be focused (optional) instead of the Google Discover page.

* üîß Fixes:
    * Fixed the Global Search Button Redirect feature for the latest version of the launcher.
