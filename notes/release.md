# üöÄ OnePlusPlusLauncher v1.2.1 Release 

## üìù Changelog

* Misc:
    * [[#4](https://github.com/wizpizz/OnePlusPlusLauncher/issues/4)] Fuzzy search now uses the lightweight [FuzzyWuzzy](https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy) library that utilizes the [Levenshtein Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) algorithm to find the closest match. 
    It handles simple typos well without any noticeable performance degredation.
    The code has also been tweaked to sanitize spaces & quotation marks from the query, since users of non-English IMEs (e.g. Chinese Pinyin) often produce search queries with such characters. 
    The calculation method has also been tweaked to prefer matches where the query is a prefix of the target or if the query chars subsequently appear in the target. (Thanks to **[@deltazefiro](https://github.com/deltazefiro)**!)
